declare mood to be light and then print dark and print mood to both times. 
declare luigisDebt to 140 and subtract 35 and print it
delcare one to be 1 and two to be 2 and print the addition . 


const is constant 
delcare greeting as constant to be Hello and print Hello Adya. Adyas should be
declared as a variable.
Find minimum of 2 and 4 and maximum of 2 and 4.

Functions
-------------
using math function, print minimum of 2 and 4. Then print the maximum of 2 and 4. 

const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});


Conditional expressions . Use Number.isNan method. 

declare theNumber to be 1 and print the square root of the number. 
Your number is the square root of theNumber.
Otherwise 
Print Why didn't give me a number?

For now use the following method.
declare num to be 10.

if num < 10 print Small.
num < 100 print Medium. 
otherwise print Large. 

while loop.
use while loop to print numbers between 0 to 12. 

declare result to be 1.
declare counter to be 0.

within the loop multiply result to be result * 2. Loop 10 times.
and then print the result. Answer should be 1024

Using a for loop print the number from 0 to 12. 

using a for loop print the result *2 and lopp 10 times to get the answer. 

Get the input from keyboard on What is the weather like? 
Use switch and case. 

if rainy print Remember to bring an umbrella.
if sunny print Dress lightly.
if cloudy  print Go Outside.
if none of the above, print Unknown weather type!


Looping a Triangle
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######


Functions
----------
a) Write a function square that returns the square of the number. 
b) Write a function makeNoise that writes "Pling!" 
c) Write a function power that return the power of 2. 
power(2, 10) = 1024
power(2,3) = 8
power(4,2) = 16

d) 
declare a variable x as "outside"
create two functions and change variables to "Inside f1" and Inside f2"


Functions within a function. 
Write a function landscape that printbelow. 
Use inner functions for the solution.


___/''''\______/'\_

My soolution.
___/''''\_______/'\_

____/''''\_______/'\



Functions as Values
------------------
Declare a function and assign it to variable launchMissiles. The function should print "Launch Now!"
then delcare a safeMode variable and if safeMode is true. reassign the varaiable to a function tha prints cancel launch.

Test it


Optional Arguments
-------------
write a function power which takes base and exponent as arguments. 
if exponent is undefined assign it to two. 

Closure
---------
Write a function wrapValue(n) which returns another function with the argument passed into wrapValue

Write a function multipler(factor) which turns function that returns factor *number. number is taken
as input into a function that is being returned.

var twice = multiplier(2);
console.log(twice(5)); 
value should be 10


Recursive Functions
-------------------
Rewrite power function using recursive solution.
Write a function findSolution. which can get to a target either by adding 3 or multiplying by 5. 
findSolution takes target to get to the solution. and should print history.


function power(base, exponent) {
    if (exponent == 0) {
        return 1;
    }else {
        return base * power(base, exponent-1);
}

Refactoring
-------
function printFarmInventory(cows, chickens) {
    var cowString = String(cows);
    while (cowString.length < 3)
      cowString = "0" + cowString;
    console.log(cowString + " Cows");
    var chickenString = String(chickens);
    while (chickenString.length < 3)
      chickenString = "0" + chickenString;
    console.log(chickenString + " Chickens");
  }
  printFarmInventory(7, 11);

Refactor the above function
and make sure that it easily accomodates pigs

Chapter 4 Arrays
-----------------
Declare an array of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and print third and first element. 


Properties. 
print the length of the above array using dot operator and square bracket operator.

String properties . 
toUpperCase()
typeof

Arrays
----
push, pop



declare doh to be Doh and print the upper case and type of doh
declare a squence to be 1 2 and 3.
add 4 and 5 at the end and remove 5. Print after both the operations.

Objects
--------
Declare an object with {} syntax. Key and value pairs are separated using colon : .

Declare a object day1 whose object properties are 
a) squirrel, 
b) events which is a list of work, touched tree pizza and running. 
print the squirrel object and second element of the events. 
c) declare an object called descriptions which have properties work (Went to Work) and touched tree (Touched a tree)
print both the values. 

in binary operator. returns if a property is in object or not.
delcare an object with left as 1 and right as 2. and then print the values. 
use in operator to test if the properties exist

Object.keys will return all the keys of the Object as an array. 
Print the keys of the object {x: 0, y: 0, z: 2}
Object.assign will copy all the properties from one object to another. 

declare an objectA to be a (1) and b(2) 
copy this object {b: 3, c: 4}); to objectA and then print the values. 

Declare an array of objects. 
--------------

First entry in an object is 
events as "work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running", "television" and squirrel to be false.
events as "work", "ice cream", "cauliflower", "lasagna", "touched tree", "brushed teeth" and squirrel as false.
events as "weekend", "cycling", "break", "peanuts",  "beer" and squirrel as true.


Declare object1 to have value 10
assign objec2 to object 1.
Test == operator on object2 and object1.
declare object3 (don't assign) to be as same as objec1 and test the equality operator.

delcare score to be an object (as constant score) having visitors (value is 0) and home (value is 0). 
reassign visitors to 1.

try to reassign score and then see the result.

Solve the problem declare an array of objects using a function. 
called addEntry 
Figure out the parameters yourself. It should be in any array called journal.


table[3] * table[0] - table[2] * table[1]) /
    Math.sqrt((table[2] + table[3]) *
              (table[0] + table[1]) *
              (table[1] + table[3]) *
              (table[0] + table[2]));
