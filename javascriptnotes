    while (chickenString.length < 3)
      chickenString = "0" + chickenString;
    console.log(chickenString + " Chickens");
  }
  printFarmInventory(7, 11);

Refactor the above function
and make sure that it easily accomodates pigs

-----------------
Declare an array of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and print third and first element. 


Properties. 
print the length of the above array using dot operator and square bracket operator.

String properties . 
toUpperCase()
typeof

Arrays
----
push, pop



declare doh to be Doh and print the upper case and type of doh
declare a squence to be 1 2 and 3.
add 4 and 5 at the end and remove 5. Print after both the operations.

Objects
--------
Declare an object with {} syntax. Key and value pairs are separated using colon : .

Declare a object day1 whose object properties are 
a) squirrel, 
b) events which is a list of work, touched tree pizza and running. 
print the squirrel object and second element of the events. 
c) declare an object called descriptions which have properties work (Went to Work) and touched tree (Touched a tree)
print both the values. 

in binary operator. returns if a property is in object or not.
delcare an object with left as 1 and right as 2. and then print the values. 
use in operator to test if the properties exist

Object.keys will return all the keys of the Object as an array. 
Print the keys of the object {x: 0, y: 0, z: 2}
Object.assign will copy all the properties from one object to another. 

declare an objectA to be a (1) and b(2) 
copy this object {b: 3, c: 4}); to objectA and then print the values. 

Declare an array of objects. 
--------------

First entry in an object is 
events as "work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running", "television" and squirrel to be false.
events as "work", "ice cream", "cauliflower", "lasagna", "touched tree", "brushed teeth" and squirrel as false.
events as "weekend", "cycling", "break", "peanuts",  "beer" and squirrel as true.


Declare object1 to have value 10
assign objec2 to object 1.
Test == operator on object2 and object1.
declare object3 (don't assign) to be as same as objec1 and test the equality operator.

delcare score to be an object (as constant score) having visitors (value is 0) and home (value is 0). 
reassign visitors to 1.

try to reassign score and then see the result.

Solve the problem declare an array of objects using a function. 
called addEntry 
Figure out the parameters yourself. It should be in any array called journal.
When added without : operator and specifying value, name ia automatically from the variable name and
value is from the value that is passed. 

write a function tableFor(event, journal)  that does the following. 
declare a table to be 0,0,0,0
if an entry of journal contains an event. then 

includes is a method, that checks to see if the includes include a particualr string. 

table)
Use the table of an array of objects and collect all the events and there should not any duplicates. 
Do it using two different ways. One using the array index and another using of operator.

Array methods.
shift, unshift, slice, indexOf, lastIndexOf

0, 1, 2, 3, 4 . Get elemnts 2, 3 and 4 from an array.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Get elemnts from 2 onwards. 

write a method remove that which removes an element at index (index) from an array. 
test it by using Remove c "a", "b", "c", "d", "e" 

to the tasks returned in table. add a task called "Worker task" in the beginning 
and then remove ti. Print the array both tiems. 


for the problem above. add a task in the beginning and remove one from the beginning. 

Strings and Their Properties
--------
slice will not remove as with arrays. 
indexOf operator defines the occurence of the stirng staarting position.
trim removes whitespaces. 
padStart will add 'any character' to the String.  
String(6).padStart(3, "0")
3 = total length. "0" string to be added. 
split will split the String into an array. 
repeat(n) will repeat the string 
join will join an array into a string.  


examples
coconunts . Use function to get nut
one two three. Find the occurence of ee.
"   okay" . Rmove the white spaces. 
For String 6 make it to 006

Secretarybirds specialize in stomping
Get all arrays of words 

Conver the array back to string. 
Secretarybirds. specialize. in. stomping

LA (make it to LALALA)

REST Parameters. Variable number of arguments 
----
Write a functiont that takes variable number of araguments and finds 
the maximum of numbers. 
function name is called max
give the solution using the variable numebr of parameters. 

max(4, 1, 9, -2) the result is 9
Function that takes variable number of arguments should have ...
and if you inoking function with an array you need to used ...

Math Object is 
-------------
Math.random()
Math.ceil()
Math.floor()

let {name} = {name: "Faraji", age: 23};

Did  not understand this at all.
[n00, n01, n10, n11] is an array notation that can be used to bind parameters of array. 

JSON.stringify and JSON.parse

Chapter 5
----------

function repeat . 

This function will repeat action n number of times. 
action can be any function.

It should take two arguments, the numebr of arguments and the input function
should take atleast one parameter. 


After the function is done. 
produce a result like the one below. 

["Unit 1", "Unit 2", "Unit 3", "Unit 4", "Unit 5"]

Return another function.
Write a function greaterThan which returns a function. 
The function returned should have another variable which does the comparision. 

Signature is greaterThan(n)

Write a function called noisy which should 
return another function which should take variable number of arguments. 
The returned function should first print
args that calling function was called with. 
and finally log the args and the result. 

calling with
noisy(Math.min)(3, 2, 1);
// → calling with [3, 2, 1]
// → called with [3, 2, 1] , returned 1

Write a function unless that takes two parameters. 
test and function called then. function called then is executed if test is false.
use repeat to produce output.

// → 0 is even
// → 2 is even

use forEach to print A and B which are in array.

https://eloquentjavascript.net/code#5
From now on you can only pracitce using coding sandbox. See link above

{
   name: "Coptic",
   ranges: [[994, 1008], [11392, 11508], [11513, 11520]],
   direction: "ltr",
   year: -200,
   living: false,
   link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_alphabet"
}

write a function filter which takes all the scripts in an array and returns all the living scripts.
function should be higher order function. 
function filter(array, test)  {


}
Array also has inbuilt filter method.

Transforming with map.
--------------
write a function map. that gets the name of the scripts in an array. should be written as 
a shigher order fucntion. 
with signature.
function map(array, transform);
transform is a function that transforms elements of an array.

solve the same using map operator on an array.

write code that filters the scripts using rtl and gets the names of those scripts.

write a reduce function. This should emulate normal reduce opeartion.
which has the following format 

function reduce(array, combine, start)

Find the script with highest numebr of characters. range property give the number of characters in each range.

use some operator to find a script whose code is 121 which lies between from and to.

Write a function countBy which takes an array and splits it into two groups, according to a function/lambda expression. 
function/lambda expression returns true or false. 

function signature 

function countBy(items, groupName)
console.log(countBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n => n > 2));
// → [
      {name: false, count: 2}, 
      {name: true, count: 3}
]


Write a higher-order function loop that provides something like a for loop statement. 
It takes a value, a test function, an update function, and a body function. 
Each iteration, it first runs the test function on the current loop value and stops if that returns false. 
Then it calls the body function, giving it the current value. 
Finally, it calls the update function to create a new value and starts from the beginning.

When defining the function, you can use a regular loop to do the actual looping.

Everything
Analogous to the some method, arrays also have an every method. 
This one returns true when the given function returns true for every element in the array.
In a way, some is a version of the || operator that acts on arrays, and every is like the && operator.

Implement every as a function that takes an array and a predicate function as parameters. Write two versions, one using a loop and one using the some method.


Chapter 6
----------
Encapsulation
-------------

Methods.
---------
declare an object called rabbit. 
and  a method called speak. 

Sample invocation and output. 
----------------
rabbit.speak("I'm alive."); should print out 
The rabbit says 'I'm alive.'

2) delcare a speak method. The speak method should use this as part of the solution.
function speak
declare whiteRabbit and hungryRabbit. 

properties of whiteRabbit
type  = "White"
spaek

properties of hungryRabbit
type  = "Hungry"
spaek

whiteRabbit.speak("Oh my ears and whiskers, " +late it's getting!
                  "how late it's getting!")
Should print out . 
// → The white rabbit says 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how
// late it's getting!'

hungryRabbit.speak("I could use a carrot right now.");
// → The hungry rabbit says 'I could use a carrot right now.'

Note single quotes around line that was given to be printed out. 

normalize() method. 
should return an array which converts a number to number/length.
Note function does not take any arguments.

normalize.call({coords: [0, 2, 3], length: 5});
// → [0, 0.4, 0.6]

Protottypes.
--------------
3) 

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf({}) ==
            Object.prototype);
// → true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype));
// → null
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Math.max) ==
            Function.prototype);
// → true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf([]) ==
            Array.prototype);
// → true

4) delcare a variable called protoRabbit which has method called speak.
do everything that should do. use prototype creation is part of solution

killerRabbit.speak("SKREEEE!");
// → The killer rabbit says 'SKREEEE!'

Object's methods are . 

Object.getPrototypeOf();
Object.assign(0;
Object.keys();


console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Rabbit) ==
            Function.prototype);
// → true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(weirdRabbit) ==
            Rabbit.prototype);
// → true
5) Create a class called Rabbit which takes type as a parameter.
and has a function called speak. which should print out the line 
The killer rabbit says 'SKREEEE!'

Class Notation:
-------------

Declare a class Rabbit, with exactly same behaviour as before. 
constructor should take type and this class should have  a method called as speak.


delcare an object which takes class as right hand parameter (as an expression)
which has a method called getWord which should return hello.

var object = new class{...};

Overriding Derived Prooperties.
-------------------

Define Rabbit object as before and 
then assign teeth to be Small for Rabbit.
Alter it for blackRabbit as long, sharp, and bloody
then print blackRabbit.teeth, 
Create another variable called RedRabbit and print the teets. 

Verify the difference in output. 

console.log(Array.prototype.toString ==
            Object.prototype.toString);
// → false
console.log([1, 2].toString());
// → 1,2


declare the following as an object. 

ages contianing following proeprties.

Name
Boris	39
Liang	22
Julia	

62

Print the following output.
Júlia is 62
Is Jack's age known?  false
// → Is toString's age known? true

create a Map
for the problem above.and print the same results.

use hasOwnProperty() to test if a property is present in t

declare a variable 
{x: 1}
and test if property x is present. 
and toString is rpesent. 


Polymorphism
--------------
for an array [1,2,3] declare a toString method using symbol that should print 
length cm of blue yarn.

The Iterator interface.
------------------------
Develop a class Matrix. which takes width, height and elemnt function (elment should be initilized to undefined)
Matrix is stored in single dimensional array. so width*3 + 2 will give second row and first column (rows and cols should start with 0)
Develop a getter get(x,y) and set(x,y,value)

develop an iterator for above. 
and test it with new Matrix(2,2, `value of ${x} and ${y}`)

Getters setters and statics
--------------------------------

Write a class called Temparature 
which should take celsius as a parameter. 
getter method of the Temparature class should 
return farenhit.
setter method should take Farenheit and return celsius. 

(F-32)/9 = c/5
F = 1.8*c + 32
C = (F -32)/1.8

output should be as follows.

let temp = new Temperature(22);
console.log(temp.fahrenheit);
// → 71.6
temp.fahrenheit = 86;
console.log(temp.celsius);
// → 30

Inheritence.
-----

Declare SymmetricMatrix
class SymmetricMatrix.
symmetric matrix must have same size. 
setter must set which follows the rules.
and a constructor 

if (x < y) return element(y, x);
      else return element(x, y); do this in constructor.

The instance of operator.
-----------------------
test SymmetricMatrix(2) is it of SymmetricMatrix type
SymmetricMatrix(2) is it  of Matrix type.
Matrix(2, 2) is it of type SymmetricMatrix


https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#5.4

To be documented.

function unless(test, then) {
  if (!test) then();
}

repeat(3, n => {
  unless(n % 2 == 1, () => {
    console.log(n, "is even");
  });
});
// → 0 is even
// → 2 is even

let rtlScripts = SCRIPTS.filter(s => s.direction == "rtl");
console.log(map(rtlScripts, s => s.name));
// → ["Adlam", "Arabic", "Imperial Aramaic", ...]
