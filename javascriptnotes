declare doh to be Doh and print the upper case and type of doh
declare a squence to be 1 2 and 3.
add 4 and 5 at the end and remove 5. Print after both the operations.

Objects
--------
Declare an object with {} syntax. Key and value pairs are separated using colon : .

Declare a object day1 whose object properties are 
a) squirrel, 
b) events which is a list of work, touched tree pizza and running. 
print the squirrel object and second element of the events. 
c) declare an object called descriptions which have properties work (Went to Work) and touched tree (Touched a tree)
print both the values. 

in binary operator. returns if a property is in object or not.
delcare an object with left as 1 and right as 2. and then print the values. 
use in operator to test if the properties exist

Object.keys will return all the keys of the Object as an array. 
Print the keys of the object {x: 0, y: 0, z: 2}
Object.assign will copy all the properties from one object to another. 

declare an objectA to be a (1) and b(2) 
copy this object {b: 3, c: 4}); to objectA and then print the values. 

Declare an array of objects. 
--------------

First entry in an object is 
events as "work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running", "television" and squirrel to be false.
events as "work", "ice cream", "cauliflower", "lasagna", "touched tree", "brushed teeth" and squirrel as false.
events as "weekend", "cycling", "break", "peanuts",  "beer" and squirrel as true.

declare object3 (don't assign) to be as same as objec1 and test the equality operator.

delcare score to be an object (as constant score) having visitors (value is 0) and home (value is 0). 
reassign visitors to 1.

try to reassign score and then see the result.

Solve the problem declare an array of objects using a function. 
called addEntry 
Figure out the parameters yourself. It should be in any array called journal.
When added without : operator and specifying value, name ia automatically from the variable name and
value is from the value that is passed. 

write a function tableFor(event, journal)  that does the following. 
declare a table to be 0,0,0,0
if an entry of journal contains an event. then 

includes is a method, that checks to see if the includes include a particualr string. 

table)
Use the table of an array of objects and collect all the events and there should not any duplicates. 
Do it using two different ways. One using the array index and another using of operator.

Array methods.
shift, unshift, slice, indexOf, lastIndexOf

0, 1, 2, 3, 4 . Get elemnts 2, 3 and 4 from an array.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Get elemnts from 2 onwards. 

write a method remove that which removes an element at index (index) from an array. 
test it by using Remove c "a", "b", "c", "d", "e" 

to the tasks returned in table. add a task called "Worker task" in the beginning 
and then remove ti. Print the array both tiems. 


for the problem above. add a task in the beginning and remove one from the beginning. 

Strings and Their Properties
--------
slice will not remove as with arrays. 
indexOf operator defines the occurence of the stirng staarting position.
trim removes whitespaces. 
padStart will add 'any character' to the String.

3 = total length. "0" string to be added. 
split will split the String into an array. 
repeat(n) will repeat the string 
join will join an array into a string.  


examples
coconunts . Use function to get nut
one two three. Find the occurence of ee.
"   okay" . Rmove the white spaces. 
For String 6 make it to 006

the maximum of numbers. 
function name is called max
give the solution using the variable numebr of parameters. 

max(4, 1, 9, -2) the result is 9
Function that takes variable number of arguments should have ...
and if you inoking function with an array you need to used ...

Math Object is 
-------------

Math.ceil()
Math.floor()

let {name} = {name: "Faraji", age: 23};

Did  not understand this at all.
[n00, n01, n10, n11] is an array notation that can be used to bind parameters of array. 

JSON.stringify and JSON.parse

Chapter 5
----------

function repeat . 

1) This function will repeat action n number of times on arguments 0 to n-1 
action can be any function.
It should take two arguments, the numebr of arguments and the input function
should take atleast one parameter. 

a)  After the function is done, produce a result as below.
// → 0
// → 1
// → 2

After the function is done. 
produce a result like the one below. 

["Unit 1", "Unit 2", "Unit 3", "Unit 4", "Unit 5"]

2)
Return another function.
Write a function greaterThan which returns a function. 
The function returned should have another variable which does the comparision. 
Signature is greaterThan(n)
test it with invocation greaterThan(10) with number as 11

3) 
Write a function called noisy which should 
return another function which can take variable number of arguments. 
The returned function should first print arguments with which it is called.
call the fucntion and which has been passed into it and then capture the result.
and finally log the arguments and the result. 

calling with
noisy(Math.min)(3, 2, 1);
// → calling with [3, 2, 1]
// → called with [3, 2, 1] ,
// returned 1

4) 
Write a function unless that takes two parameters, both of which are functions.
test (a function) and function called then. function called then is executed if test is false.

a) 
use repeat along with 4 to produce the following output.
// → 0 is even
// → 2 is even
should be repeat(3, ...lambda expressions)


use forEach to print A and B which are an array that has A, and B.

5) Filter.
Write a function filter(array, test) which returns an array of elements that
passs a test.
//find all living scripts. using living as a prroperty

// → [{name: "Adlam", ...}, ...]

b) Use ibuiolt filter to get the same result.
c) fild all scripts whose direction is ttb.



Transforming with map.
--------------
6) write a function map. that gets the name of the scripts in an array. should be written as 
a shigher order fucntion. 
with signature.
function map(array, transform);
transform is a function that transforms elements of an array.

a) test it with code . Print all the scripts whose direction is rtl and get names of the scripts in 
an array and print them. Output below.

["Adlam", "Arabic", "Imperial Aramaic", ...]
Solve the same using map operator on an array.

write code that filters the scripts using rtl and gets the names of those scripts. Use function map 
as well as native map to give solutions.

7)
write a reduce function. This should emulate normal reduce opeartion.
which has the following format 
// combine is higher order function.
function reduce(array, combine, start)

Test it with 
console.log(reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], (a, b) => a + b, 0));
// → 10
Use inbuilt reduce for getting the same result.


8) 
To solve the problem, first write a function called characterCount which takes a script as an input, and 
produces a count of all characters.

Find the script with highest numebr of characters. 
range property give the number of characters in each range.

Then use the function that is developed to give the soltuion.
Use Lambda expression for above.
// → {name: "Han", ...}

9) 
write a function average which gives average of all elements in an array.

a) Find all living scripts and get their average year. 
living and year are the proeprties that you will be intereseted in.
// → 1188

b) Find all dead scripts and get their average year. 
living and year are the proeprties that you will be intereseted in.
// → 188


solve both a and b using higher order functions as well as normal for loop.

10) 
Write a function characterScript(code) which returns a scirpt if the code belongs to 
one of th ranges.  use some method for the solution above.

console.log(characterScript(121));
// → {name: "Latin", ...}

11) Recognizing text.

Write a function countBy(items, groupName)
items is a character array and groupName is a higher order function. 

invocation
console.log(countBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n => n > 2));
// → [{name: false, count: 2}, {name: true, count: 3}]

12) Write a function textScripts(text)
that can summarize text with the scripts that are used.

console.log(textScripts('英国的狗说"woof", 俄罗斯的狗说"тяв"')); should produce the 
following result below.
// → 61% Han, 22% Latin, 17% Cyrillic

Solve the exercises.


Chapter 6
----------
Encapsulation
-------------

Methods.
---------
declare an object called rabbit. 
and  a method called speak. 

Sample invocation and output. 
----------------
rabbit.speak("I'm alive."); should print out 
The rabbit says 'I'm alive.'

2) delcare a speak method. The speak method should use this as part of the solution.
function speak
declare whiteRabbit and hungryRabbit. 

properties of whiteRabbit
type  = "White"
spaek

properties of hungryRabbit
type  = "Hungry"
spaek

whiteRabbit.speak("Oh my ears and whiskers, " +late it's getting!
                  "how late it's getting!")
Should print out . 
// → The white rabbit says 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how
// late it's getting!'

hungryRabbit.speak("I could use a carrot right now.");
// → The hungry rabbit says 'I could use a carrot right now.'

Note single quotes around line that was given to be printed out. 

normalize() method. 
should return an array which converts a number to number/length.
Note function does not take any arguments.

use call as part of the solutioon. call with [0, 2, 3] and length

// → [0, 0.4, 0.6]

Protottypes.
--------------
3) 

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf({}) ==
            Object.prototype);
// → true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype));
// → null

getPrototype of Math.max . Compare this with Function's prototype.
get progottype of [] . Compaare this with Array's prototype

4) delcare a variable called protoRabbit which has method called speak.
do everything that should do. use prototype creation is part of solution

killerRabbit.speak("SKREEEE!");
// → The killer rabbit says 'SKREEEE!'

Object's methods are . 

Object.getPrototypeOf();
Object.assign(0;
Object.keys();

// Do this using prototype method

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Rabbit) ==
            Function.prototype);
// → true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(weirdRabbit) ==
            Rabbit.prototype);
// → true
5) Create a class called Rabbit which takes type as a parameter.
and has a function called speak. which should print out the line 
Use Function way as part of the solution.

declare weiredRabbit as an instance. and test it out.

compare Rabbit's prototype to a function's

// → true
compare weiredRabbit's to Rabbit's prototype. What's the difference between getPrototypeOf and
.prototype method.

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(weirdRabbit) ==
            Rabbit.prototype);
// → true


Class Notation:
-------------

Declare a class Rabbit, with exactly same behaviour as before. 
constructor should take type and this class should have  a method called as speak.

Declare killerRabbit and blackRabbit and invoke speak method.


delcare an object which takes class as right hand parameter (as an expression)
which has a method called getWord which should return hello.

var object = new class{...};

Overriding Derived Prooperties.
-------------------

Define Rabbit object as before and 
then assign teeth to be Small for Rabbit.
Alter it for blackRabbit as long, sharp, and bloody
then print blackRabbit.teeth, 
Create another variable called RedRabbit and print the teets. 

Verify the difference in output. 

console.log(Array.prototype.toString ==
            Object.prototype.toString);
// → false
console.log([1, 2].toString());
// → 1,2


declare the following as an object. 

ages contianing following proeprties.

Name
Boris	39
Liang	22
Julia	62

62

Print the following output.
Júlia is 62
Is Jack's age known?  false
// → Is toString's age known? true

create a Map
for the problem above.and print the same results.

use hasOwnProperty() to test if a property is present in t

declare a variable 
{x: 1}
and test if property x is present. 
and toString is rpesent. 


Polymorphism
--------------
console.log(String(blackRabbit));
// → a black rabbit


for an array [1,2,3] declare a toString method using symbol that should print 
length cm of blue yarn.

Symbol.
Assign Symbol("name") to variable called sym.
check if sym == Symbol("name");

Do something that gest the output below.

console.log([1, 2].toString());
// → 1,2
console.log([1, 2][toStringSymbol]());
// → 2 cm of blue yarn


The Iterator interface.
------------------------
Develop a class Matrix. which takes width, height and elemnt function (elment should be initilized to undefined)
Matrix is stored in single dimensional array. so width*3 + 2 will give second row and first column (rows and cols should start with 0)
Develop a getter get(x,y) and set(x,y,value)

develop an iterator for above. 
and test it with new Matrix(2,2, `value of ${x} and ${y}`)

Getters setters and statics
--------------------------------

Write a class called Temparature 
which should take celsius as a parameter. 
getter method of the Temparature class should 
return farenhit.
setter method should take Farenheit and return celsius. 

(F-32)/9 = c/5
F = 1.8*c + 32
C = (F -32)/1.8

output should be as follows.

let temp = new Temperature(22);
console.log(temp.fahrenheit);
// → 71.6
temp.fahrenheit = 86;
console.log(temp.celsius);
// → 30

Inheritence.
-----

Declare SymmetricMatrix
class SymmetricMatrix.
symmetric matrix must have same size. 
setter must set which follows the rules.
and a constructor 

if (x < y) return element(y, x);
      else return element(x, y); do this in constructor.

The instance of operator.
-----------------------
test SymmetricMatrix(2) is it of SymmetricMatrix type
SymmetricMatrix(2) is it  of Matrix type.
Matrix(2, 2) is it of type SymmetricMatrix


https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#5.4

To be documented.

function unless(test, then) {
  if (!test) then();
}

repeat(3, n => {
  unless(n % 2 == 1, () => {
    console.log(n, "is even");
  });
});
// → 0 is even
// → 2 is even

let rtlScripts = SCRIPTS.filter(s => s.direction == "rtl");
console.log(map(rtlScripts, s => s.name));
// → ["Adlam", "Arabic", "Imperial Aramaic", ...]

document testScripts

 filter(({name}) => {  return name != "none";});

  let total = scripts.reduce((n, {count}) => n + count, 0);
  if (total == 0) return "No scripts found";

  return scripts.map(({name, count}) => {
    return `${Math.round(count * 100 / total)}% ${name}`;
  }).join(", ");
}
